            <p>
                The Golden Gate Bridge is a symbol of San Francisco.  It is a one mile long suspension bridge which links San Francisco California with nearby Marin County.  The bridge was officially opened in 1937 when it became both the longest and tallest suspension bridge in the world at that time.  
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The distinctive colour is officially called ‘International Orange’ and this was originally the the colour of the sealant originally used on the bridge.  The paint on the bridge is maintained by a team of 38 painters who touch up the paintwork as and when necessary.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The bridge is notable for another reason, it cost $35 million ($1.3 million less than expected) and it was completed ahead of schedule.  Something that is extremely unusual for a building project of that scale.
            </p>

            <p>
                Constructing the bridge was no easy task and 11 workers died during the construction due to falling.  There was a safety net under the construction but this was not always effective.  It did save the lives of 19 men who became members of the ‘Halfway to Hell club’.
