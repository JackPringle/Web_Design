                The Taj Mahal is an iconic symbol of India and a hugely popular tourist attraction (it is visited by between 7 and 8 million visitors every year).  The name ‘Taj Mahal’ translates as ‘Crown of the Palace’ and it was commissioned by the Mughal Emperor (Shah Jahan) to house the tomb of his favourite wife.

                The distinctive colour is officially called ‘International Orange’ and this was originally the the colour of the sealant originally used on the bridge.  The paint on the bridge is maintained by a team of 38 painters who touch up the paintwork as and when necessary.

                The complex, completed in 1653, took 10 years to build and cost 32 million rupees.  It provided employment for 20,000 artisans.  Whilst 32 million rupees might not sound like all that much in ‘today’s money, if we were to translate 32 million rupees (back in 1653), it would equate to 827 million US dollars.

                The Taj Mahal is a UNESCO World Heritage site and both the inside and outside are full of beautiful, ornate designs.  One of the most distinctive features of the ‘Taj’ is the ‘onion’ dome at the top which also features a lotus flower.  The dome has been designed to make it look as big as possible and it combines a mix of Persian and Hindu elements.
