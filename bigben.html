                Big Ben is a distinguishing feature of London’s skyline.  The name ‘Big Ben’ has come to mean both the clock and the clock tower and this landmark is very popular with tourists and locals alike.

                It was completed in 1859 and at that point it was the largest, accurate four-faced chiming clock in the world.  Not only does Big Ben look really distinctive, it chimes every fifteen minutes which means that if you are in London, a watch is not all that vital.

                Big Ben, has, in many ways come to symbolise London and in TV / Film, a shot of Big Ben will often be used to show viewers that the scene is set in London.
            </p>

                The clock has an interesting history and there have been times when the chimes have not been heard.  For example, the bells were silenced on purpose to avoid Zeppelins for two years during the First World War.  On a lighter note, in 1949, the clock was slowed by four and a half minutes after a flock of starlings perched on the minute hand.
